# PekeBot
Telegram bot for pok√©mon go task reporting

First of all you have to set up your database information and bot token in `config.py`

Then, you shall be able to run the bot by just executing `bot.py`

The bot is running with a MongoDB database, so you probably have to re-write most of `bot_utils.py` if you are using any other database server
